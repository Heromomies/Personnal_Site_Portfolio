          <p>This project was made in 6 weeks on Unity for our school 1st year final project.
            <br>
            SPLASH IT! is a local multiplayer game for 2 to 4 players, in which you incarnate a cartoon character in a fade world, and your goal is to paint the world with your color as much as possible and try to prevent other players from
            repainting the world.
            <br>
            The game was made cooperatively with a game artists team and some music artists, we thank them for their graph/sounds and their participation in the project.
